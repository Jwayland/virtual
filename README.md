This repository will showcase the applications that I built through my studies with Udacity. I am currently working on trying to get APK files larger than 25MB on github so the user can download and explore my virtual worlds on their Andriod device.

The purpose of the application is to educate the user on virtual reality's impact on various industries.
I created a 4 scenes, Main Menu, Architecture, Real Estate, and Construction. 
Each scene contains viewing stations and practical applications for each industry category.
The user can navigate between these scenes by clicking buttons for each industry.
Each industry scene has a button by the users feet to navigate back to the main menu scene.

### Project Description
The application that I created was intended to tap in to the human emotion of excitement to spark innovation. 
The purpose of the app is to allow the user to design their very own landscape given a blank template to design upon.  
For this project I custom built my own three dimensional exterior building layouts with Google SketchUp.  
Using Unity, I added interactive orbs that can be used to design your own aesthetic outdoor living space. 
By following the project write up link below, you will find a summarization of the steps I have taken to design, implement, and complete my final capstone project.
